## How do I clone an entire board?

	2. You click the button.
	3. You pick a name for the new Board.
	4. We clone the active board, and take you to the clone.

## How do I clone a card?
	1. Click the menu icon in the top-right corner of a card.

## How do I clone a list?
	1. Same as cloning a card, just available through the list's menu.

	
## Why is this cool?
* Trello does not natively support templating functionality
* We used cool technologies
	* Backbone
	* jQuery
	* Underscore
	* LiveQuery
	* Continuation Passing Style
	* Google Chrome Extention (with javascript injection hack)
