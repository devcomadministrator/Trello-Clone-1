## How does it work?

	1. We add a button to you're left side Trello navigation called 'clone'.
	2. You click the button
	3. You pick a name for the new Board.
	3. We clone the active board, and take you to it.
	
## Why is this cool?
* Trello does not support templating functionality
* We used cool technologies
	* Backbone
	* JQuery
	* Underscore
	* Live Query
	* Custom Asyncronous Coninuation Passing Style
	* Google Chrome Extentions (with javascript injection hack)
